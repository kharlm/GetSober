Get Sober is a Blood Alcohol Content calculator that takes the number of drinks you've had and tell show long it will be before you are sober enough to legally drive. 

It works by taking into account the User's weight, sex and number of drinks and calculate how drunk you are and gives you a timer

of how long it will take for you to get sober. 

If you are too drunk with the click of a button you can open up the Uber app or simply set an alarm right from the app that will wake you up once your sober enough to drive.

Please note the app provides estimates of your current Blood Alcohol Content level and is not 100% accurate.
